Machine learning with Python 
 
Introduction of Python and its libraries 

•	Numpy – Used for numerical data to analyze and process the data 

•	Pandas – Labeled data analysis and process the data (Selection, filtering) 

•	Matplotlib – For data visualization 

•	Seaborn – Built on top of Matplotlib 

•	Scikit learn – For predictive data analysis 

The whole thing we do is called EDA – Exploratory Data Analysis. You typically collect the data, clean the data, process the data, exploration and selection of right algorithms and inference the model.

Basic exercise of Python: 

•	Native Data Types in Python 

•	Introduction to Pandas library and basics Dataframe attributes

•	Common Data manipulation tasks using Pandas 

•	Loops and Functions 

•	Visualization 

•	Other miscellaneous topics 

 
Data types:

•	List

•	Tuple

•	Dictionary

Introduction to Pandas:

1. Basic Dataframe operations
2. Common data manipulation tasks
3. Loops and functions

Data manipulation

1. Selecting/Indexing
2. Filtering
3. Sorting
4. Mutating/ Conditionally adding columns
5. Groupby/Summarize and apply

Iloc – accessing using index of row and columns

Loc - : Label based indexing

Grouping – SAC

Split, Apply and combine

Visualization: we can tell story with data

Matplotlib and seaborn

Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib

There are two types:

Univariate – Deal with one variable

Example: Age of the people

Histogram:
Bar chart with bins

Example: Location of the people
Bar Chart

Bivariate – Deal with two variables

Example: Age and salary

Scatter plot

Example: Mean of location of people

Box Plot 
5 summaries

Basic of statistics

Descriptive
